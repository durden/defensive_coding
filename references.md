# Presenter notes

- This talk is pretty pessimistic b/c sadly a lot of being a programmer
  means thinking of what can and will go wrong.  However, the irony of this
  talk is that the ideas are presented in an optimistic manner.
- For example, 'here is your problem. now here is the easy solution.'
- This obviously isn't the real world:
    - Take these ideas and try it out
    - Use what works, throw away what doesn't
    - The important thing is to try something different and change your
        mindset from preventing bugs to a mindset of they will happen no
        matter what I do, so how can I fight back and make the
        maintenance phase of a project easier now with the smallest
        amount of effort.
